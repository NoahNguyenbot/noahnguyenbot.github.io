During my first year of college I decided to create a tic tac toe game using java. For anyone who's played tic tac toe before, the objective of the game should be pretty obvious. But for anyone who hasn't, it's simple. The game starts on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns. One player uses X and the other uses O. The goal is to be the first to get your smybol in a straight line, either vertically, horizontally, or diagnoly.
  When I made this game, I had just started learning java through my ICS 111 course, so at the time, this project helped me learn about how static methods through the various helper functions implemeted. It also taught me how Arrays worked as well through array indexing.
