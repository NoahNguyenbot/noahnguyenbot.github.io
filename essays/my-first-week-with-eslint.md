## ESLint’s Not-So-Gentle Welcome

When I first started using ESLint in VS Code about a week ago, the amount of warnings that appeared every time I saved a file felt like the editor was criticizing my every move. It flagged missing semicolons, pointed out when I used == instead of ===, highlighted variables I declared but never used, and called out indentation that wasn’t perfectly even. With only limited coding experience and having seen similar nagging from Checkstyle in jGRASP, I still wasn’t prepared for how constant it felt in JavaScript. My immediate reaction was, “The code runs, why does this matter so much?” But even in just these first seven days, I’ve begun to realize those warnings aren’t random complaints; they’re actually showing me habits that could lead to confusion or bugs later on.

## The Repetition That’s Starting to Pay Off

This first week has been mostly frustrating. I often have to pause and look up why a particular rule exists, and I lean a lot on the auto-fix option when it’s there to save time. Still, the repetition is already making a difference. I’m catching myself choosing const over let more naturally, I’m using === without thinking about it as much, and I spot unused variables sooner after typing them. It’s nowhere near automatic yet, but the pattern is clear: every time I fix something, it reinforces a slightly better way of writing code. The linter has been tough and a bit overwhelming so far, but it’s also acting like a persistent coach that keeps nudging me toward cleaner choices.


## One Week Later: Starting to See the Long Game

Even after only a week, I can already see the payoff in having more uniform-looking files , similar naming styles, and the same approach to loops and conditions. Reading my own code feels a little less messy and more deliberate, which makes it easier to spot problems or add new pieces later. I’m starting to get why people value these standards. They're not about being perfect right away, but about making code easier to understand, maintain, and fix, whether for me months from now or for anyone else who might work on it. The annoyance is still there, but I’m convinced sticking with it will pay off. The early struggle is temporary, and the clearer, more confident code I’m slowly building will last a lot longer. One week in, and I'm beginning to build more confidence reading and fixing errors using ESLint.
